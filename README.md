# Legalize

**Legislation as code.** Every law as a Markdown file. Every reform as a Git commit.

Legalize turns official legislation into version-controlled, machine-readable data. Browse, search, diff, and build on structured legal data from multiple countries.

**[legalize.dev](https://legalize.dev)** — Browse laws, see diffs, search across legislation.

## How it works

Each law is a Markdown file with YAML frontmatter. When a reform is published, the file is updated and committed with the official publication date.

Standard Git tools become legal research tools:

```bash
# Clone Spanish legislation
git clone https://github.com/legalize-dev/legalize-es.git

# What does Article 135 of the Constitution say today?
grep -A 10 "Artículo 135" spain/BOE-A-1978-31229.md

# When did it change?
git log --oneline -- spain/BOE-A-1978-31229.md

# Show the exact diff of the 2011 fiscal stability reform
git diff 6660bcf^..6660bcf -- spain/BOE-A-1978-31229.md
```
## MCP Server

This repository also acts as the **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server** for the Legalize ecosystem. By running this server, you can allow any AI Assistant (Claude Desktop, Cursor) to search and read the laws of *all* cloned country repositories dynamically!

### 1. Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/legalize-dev/legalize mcp-legalize
cd mcp-legalize
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Add Country Repositories

Clone the countries you want to access inside the `repos/` subdirectory:

```bash
mkdir repos
git clone https://github.com/legalize-dev/legalize-es repos/legalize-es
```

### 3. Generate Indices

Run the indexing script for the cloned countries:

```bash
python scripts/update_index.py --repo repos/legalize-es
```

### 4. Connect your AI

Add this server to your AI's MCP config:
- **Command:** `python`
- **Args:** `["/absolute/path/to/mcp-legalize/mcp_legalize.py"]`

## Why

Legal texts are amended constantly, but tracking changes is hard. Official sources publish consolidated versions with no way to compare. Commercial providers charge hundreds per month for version history.

Legalize is open legal infrastructure:

- **For developers** — structured, versioned legal data with a REST API
- **For researchers and journalists** — explore the evolution of legislation with git
- **For citizens** — see how the laws that affect you have changed

## Contributing

The main contribution is adding a new country. Read the [format spec](SPEC.md) for the minimal contract, then follow the [step-by-step guide](https://github.com/legalize-dev/legalize-pipeline/blob/main/ADDING_A_COUNTRY.md).

You can use the shared [legalize-pipeline](https://github.com/legalize-dev/legalize-pipeline) or build your own pipeline — as long as the output follows the spec. South Korea was built with an independent pipeline and it works great.

Found an error in a law text? Open an issue in the relevant country repo with the law name, article, and the official source showing the correct version.
